    <p>Adidas Samba is an athletic shoe manufactured by German multinational Adidas. It was designed by Adidas founder Adolf Dassler in 1949. It is the second-highest selling Adidas design with over 35 million pairs sold worldwide, behind the Stan Smith model. It has been produced in a variety of color schemes.</p>

    <div id="sec1">
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The Samba was designed in 1949 to enable football players to train on icy, hard ground (hence the suction design on the gumsole). Its original design featured the classic three stripes, as well as the gold trefoil on the foldable tongue. As years progressed, the trainer evolved into the Samba Millennium (which was made without the extended tongue) and the Samba '85. Vintage versions of the trainer are still in production, under the name Classic M.</p>
        <p>Some sources have said the name was inspired by the Samba being released close to the 1950 soccer World Cup in Brazil and the country's association with samba music and carnival culture. However, Adidas has said this was not the case, and that the shoe was given the nickname at German football matches.</p>

    <div id="sec2">
        <h2>Models</h2>
        <p>Over time, the three stripes detail has been made consistent on all versions of the Samba.</p>

            <a href="https://www.adidas.com/us/samba-og-shoes/B75807.html"><h3>Samba OG</h3></a>
            <p>The Samba OG is typically constructed with a mix of suede and leather, a contrasting gum sole and the three-stripe trademark.
                The Samba name in capitals is embossed in gold alongside the three stripes.</p>

            <a href="https://www.adidas.com/us/samba-adv-shoes/JP5859.html"><h3>Samba ADV</h3></a>
            <p>During the 1990s, skateboarders started to wear Sambas. So in 2017, the Samba ADV was designed for this market. 
                The ADV has a leather and suede upper panel, molded heel clip, support provided by a sockliner, tread, internal mesh bootie, and a gum capsule.</p>


            <a href="https://www.adidas.com/us/samba-classic/034563.html"><h3>Samba Classic</h3></a>
            <p>The Samba Classic is specifically designed for five-a-side and indoor soccer. 
                It has an extended tongue and a lightweight synthetic construction with EVA-injected soles. The Samba branding on the side and tongue of the shoe are in larger type.</p>

            <p>
                The Samba Vegan is crafted using faux leather, eliminating the use of animal products. Typically, these versions also incorporate more sustainable fabrics.

            <p>
                While the upper panel of the sneaker resembles the Samba OG, it incorporates a distinctive feature in the midsole for biking. The underpart is designed to accommodate two-bolt pedal cleats.

        <h2>Pop Culture</h2>
        <p>
            The Samba has been featured in various television shows and movies, with the most notable first appearance dating back to the 1980s film Beverly Hills Cop, where Eddie Murphy's character, Axel Foley, wore the sneakers throughout. 
            Kelso in That '70s Show, portrayed by Ashton Kutcher, also wore Sambas. In the 1996 film Trainspotting, Mark Renton (Ewan McGregor) sports the Samba Super in burgundy. Characters in Entourage, Remember the Titans, and You highlight the shoe in popular culture.
        </p>
        <p>
            The UK prime minister Rishi Sunak apologised in April 2024 for wearing Samba trainers after some social media users were reported as saying they would sell their shoes because "Sunak had ruined the look for everyone".
            Days later, the Sunday Times carried a Nick Newman cartoon of a shoe salesman with a speech bubble saying: "Thanks to Rishi Sunak nobody nicks Adidas Samba trainers any more." In April, Samba sales in Britain fell by 11% compared to the prior month.

            Dingyun Zhang, a Chinese designer and former collaborator with Yeezy, has partnered with Adidas for his first-ever Adidas collaboration. This unique shoe will be available for purchase starting on 10 May 2024.
